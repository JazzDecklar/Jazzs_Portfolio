  <div class="My Background info">
    <p>I have college credits in both Music and Psychology. I decided that the traditional college education isn't something I want to contiue at this current moment. I come from a family with no higher education experience with many financial setbacks, so creating financial security for myself is a new experience in more ways than one. I have diverse work experience including Customer Service, Manual labor and Counselling at camp. </p>
