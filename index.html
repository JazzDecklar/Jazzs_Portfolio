    <h3>My Background</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="My_Background_info">
    <p>I have college credits in both <strong>Music</strong> and <strong>Psychology</strong>. I decided that the traditional college education isn't something I want to contiue at this current moment. I come from a family with no higher education experience with many financial setbacks, so creating financial security for myself is both new and exciting. I have diverse work experience including Customer Service, Manual labor and Counselling at summer camps. </p>
